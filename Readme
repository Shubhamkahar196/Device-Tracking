# üì° Device-Tracking ‚Äì Full Setup & Usage Guide

This guide explains how to install, configure, and run the **Device-Tracking** project as a Linux service that:

- Starts automatically on boot
- Uses your **Linux username** as the device name (via `whoami`)
- Displays your real-time location on a map

---

## üß± Requirements

- Ubuntu or Debian-based Linux
- `nvm` (Node Version Manager)
- Node.js v20+
- systemd (comes pre-installed)

---

## üìÅ Project Structure (Already Included)

Make sure your folder looks like this:

```
~/Device-Tracking/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/js/script.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ views/index.ejs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start-device-tracker.sh        ‚úÖ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ device-tracker.service         ‚úÖ
```

## üß∞ Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### ‚úÖ 1. Install Node.js Using `nvm`

If not already installed:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```

Verify:

```bash
node -v
# Should be v20.x.x
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
cd ~/Device-Tracking
npm install
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Configure `start-device-tracker.sh`

> This script is already in your project root.

**Ensure it looks like this:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

exec > /tmp/device-tracker.log 2>&1

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
source "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
nvm use 20

cd "$HOME/Device-Tracking"
DEVICE_NAME="$(whoami)"
export DEVICE_NAME

node app.js
```

Then make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x ~/start-device-tracker.sh
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Register the Service

You already have `device-tracker.service` inside your repo.  
You just need to **copy it** to the correct system location:

```bash
sudo cp ~/Device-Tracking/device-tracker.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Enable and Start the Service

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable device-tracker.service
sudo systemctl start device-tracker.service
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. View Logs or Debug

To check service output in real time:

```bash
journalctl -u device-tracker.service -f
```

Or view the full output log:
```bash
cat /tmp/device-tracker.log
```

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Access the Tracker

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You‚Äôll see a map with a marker labeled with your Linux username.

---

## üîç How It Works

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| `start-device-tracker.sh` | Starts the server and sets device name to `whoami` |
| `device-tracker.service` | Calls the script automatically on system boot |
| `index.ejs` | Injects the device name into the browser |
| `script.js` | Sends the location and device name to the server |
| `app.js` | Receives and broadcasts the location to all connected clients |

---

## üßπ Service Management

| Action         | Command                                  |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Restart        | `sudo systemctl restart device-tracker`  |
| Stop           | `sudo systemctl stop device-tracker`     |
| Disable        | `sudo systemctl disable device-tracker`  |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- ‚úî You **already have** all required files.
- üîß You only need to **install Node**, **install dependencies**, and **copy & enable the service**.
- üîÅ The service will now start every time your system boots and track your location automatically.
